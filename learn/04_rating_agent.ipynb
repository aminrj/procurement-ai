    "## 🎉 Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You built a sophisticated rating agent!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-dimensional scoring** - Avoid single-number bias\n",
    "2. **Balanced analysis** - Force consideration of both strengths and risks\n",
    "3. **Company context matters** - Prompt includes capabilities and constraints\n",
    "4. **Comparative ranking** - Multiple scores enable prioritization\n",
    "5. **Business logic integration** - Thresholds and rules on top of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Decision | Rationale |\n",
    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| Temperature 0.1 | Consistent scoring across tenders |\n",
    "| Multiple dimensions | More nuanced than single score |\n",
    "| Required strengths AND risks | Prevents overly optimistic ratings |\n",
    "| 0-10 scale | Intuitive and fine-grained |\n",
    "| Company profile in prompt | Context for realistic assessment |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Engineering Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit calibration** - \"Most should score 5-7, not 8-10\"\n",
    "2. **Multiple perspectives** - Force analysis from different angles\n",
    "3. **Concrete criteria** - Not just \"rate this\", but \"rate on X, Y, Z\"\n",
    "4. **Role definition** - \"15 years experience\" sets expectation\n",
    "5. **Balanced instructions** - \"Realistic, not optimistic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can:\n",
    "1. ✓ Filter tenders for relevance\n",
    "2. ✓ Rate opportunities on multiple dimensions\n",
    "3. ? Generate professional bid documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build the document generator!\n",
