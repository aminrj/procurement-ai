    "## The Solution: RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating from scratch, we:\n",
    "1. **Build a knowledge base** of high-quality example documents\n",
    "2. **Retrieve relevant examples** similar to the current tender\n",
    "3. **Augment the prompt** with these examples before generation\n",

    "### 2. Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine semantic search with keyword matching:\n",
    "- Semantic: Finds conceptually similar docs\n",
    "- Keyword: Ensures specific terms are present\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "After retrieval, re-rank by:\n",
    "- Recency (prefer newer examples)\n",
    "- Success rate (prefer proven approaches)\n",
    "- Specificity (prefer detailed over generic)\n",

    "### 4. Dynamic k\n",

    "Retrieve variable numbers of examples:\n",
    "- Complex tender → More examples (k=3-4)\n",
    "- Simple tender → Fewer examples (k=1-2)\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of whole documents:\n",

    "## Summary: What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build Knowledge Base**: Collect high-quality example documents\n",
    "2. **Create Embeddings**: Convert text to vectors using embedding models\n",
    "3. **Store in Vector DB**: Use ChromaDB for efficient similarity search\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Find relevant examples for each new request\n",
    "5. **Augment**: Add examples to LLM prompt\n",
    "6. **Generate**: LLM produces better output informed by examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quality Improvement**: Documents match professional standards  \n",
    "✅ **Domain Adaptation**: LLM learns your specific patterns  \n",
    "✅ **Consistency**: Examples ensure similar structure/tone  \n",
    "✅ **Reduced Hallucination**: Grounded in real examples  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is powerful when:\n",
    "- You have high-quality example documents\n",
    "- Output quality matters (not just correctness)\n",
    "- Domain-specific knowledge is needed\n",
    "- You want to incorporate institutional knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand RAG, we'll:\n",
    "1. Integrate it into the DocumentGenerator agent\n",
    "2. Build a knowledge base management system\n",
    "3. Add evaluation to measure RAG impact\n",
    "4. Deploy to production\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these to deepen your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add more examples**: Create 2-3 more knowledge base entries in different categories\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test edge cases**: What happens when you query about a category not in the KB?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiment with k**: Try n_results=1, 2, 3, 4. How does it affect output?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Metadata filtering**: Modify search to only retrieve from one category\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quality comparison**: Generate 3 documents (with/without RAG) and compare side-by-side\n",
    "\n",
