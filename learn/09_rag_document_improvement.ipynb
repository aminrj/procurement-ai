    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines information retrieval with LLM generation to produce better outputs.\n",

    "- What good procurement documents look like for our domain\n",
    "- Common patterns in successful bids\n",
    "- Domain-specific terminology and structure\n",

    "**Result**: Documents are grammatically correct but lack the quality and specificity of human-written bids.\n",

    "## The Solution: RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating from scratch, we:\n",
    "1. **Build a knowledge base** of high-quality example documents\n",
    "2. **Retrieve relevant examples** similar to the current tender\n",
    "3. **Augment the prompt** with these examples before generation\n",

      "We propose a fully‑integrated, AI‑powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that delivers real‑time diagnostic insights and treatment recommendations while safeguarding patient confidentiality. Leveraging state‑of‑the‑art natural‑language processing, federated learning and explainable AI, the solution will be deployed within 12 months at a cost of €1.5 M. Our architecture is ISO 27001‑certified and meets UK HIPAA equivalents, ensuring data integrity, auditability and compliance with the NHS Digital Data Security & Protection Toolkit.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Approach  \n",
      "1. **Data Layer** – Secure, encrypted storage on NHS‑approved cloud infrastructure with role‑based access control. Federated learning pipelines aggregate anonymised signals from multiple sites without moving raw data.  \n",
      "2. **AI Engine** – Transformer‑based models fine‑tuned on NHS datasets, coupled with probabilistic disease‑prediction modules. Confidence scores and evidence trails are generated for every recommendation to satisfy clinical audit requirements.  \n",
      "3. **Integration** – RESTful APIs and HL7 FHIR adapters embed the CDSS into existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) workflows. Real‑time alerts are pushed to clinicians via the NHS portal or mobile device.  \n",
      "4. **Governance & Compliance** – End‑to‑end encryption, data minimisation, and continuous vulnerability scanning. Regular penetration tests and ISO 27001 audit cycles are built into the delivery plan.\n",

      "**Executive Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "We propose a fully‑integrated, AI‑powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for the National Health Service that delivers real‑time diagnostic insights and personalized treatment recommendations while meeting stringent ISO 27001 and HIPAA standards. Leveraging federated learning, secure multi‑party computation, and explainable AI, the platform will ingest EMR data, laboratory results, imaging metadata, and clinician notes to produce evidence‑based suggestions that can be reviewed, overridden, or accepted by clinicians. Pilot studies in two NHS trusts have shown a 22 % increase in diagnostic accuracy and a 15 % reduction in treatment cycle times, with no compromise on patient privacy. The €1.5 M investment covers system design, implementation, staff training, and a 12‑month post‑deployment support window.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technical Approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Ingestion & Governance**  \n",
      "   • Secure API gateways (FHIR‑based) aggregate structured and unstructured data from EMR, PACS, and laboratory systems.  \n",
      "   • Data is anonymized on‑premises using tokenization and differential privacy before feeding the ML pipeline, preserving HIPAA “minimum necessary” principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model Architecture**  \n",
      "   • Multi‑modal transformer models fuse structured vitals, lab values, imaging embeddings, and NLP‑extracted clinical notes.  \n",
      "   • Federated learning across NHS sites trains a global model without moving patient data, ensuring compliance and reducing bandwidth costs.  \n",
      "   • Explainability modules (SHAP, LIME) provide transparent rationale for each recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inference & Alerting**  \n",
      "   • Real‑time inference engine (ONNX runtime) delivers diagnostics within 2 seconds of data entry.  \n",
      "   • Clinical dashboards and EMR widgets present ranked differential diagnoses, risk scores, and evidence‑based treatment pathways.  \n",
      "   • Configurable alert thresholds trigger physician notifications via secure messaging or EMR alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Security & Compliance**  \n",
      "   • End‑to‑end encryption (TLS 1.3, AES‑256) and role‑based access control enforce ISO 27001 controls.  \n",
      "   • Regular penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and automated compliance reporting satisfy HIPAA Security Rule requirements.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "Retrieve only from specific categories:\n",

    "### 2. Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine semantic search with keyword matching:\n",
    "- Semantic: Finds conceptually similar docs\n",
    "- Keyword: Ensures specific terms are present\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Re-ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "After retrieval, re-rank by:\n",
    "- Recency (prefer newer examples)\n",
    "- Success rate (prefer proven approaches)\n",
    "- Specificity (prefer detailed over generic)\n",

    "## Summary: What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build Knowledge Base**: Collect high-quality example documents\n",
    "2. **Create Embeddings**: Convert text to vectors using embedding models\n",
    "3. **Store in Vector DB**: Use ChromaDB for efficient similarity search\n",
    "4. **Retrieve**: Find relevant examples for each new request\n",
    "5. **Augment**: Add examples to LLM prompt\n",
    "6. **Generate**: LLM produces better output informed by examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quality Improvement**: Documents match professional standards  \n",
    "✅ **Domain Adaptation**: LLM learns your specific patterns  \n",
    "✅ **Consistency**: Examples ensure similar structure/tone  \n",
    "✅ **Reduced Hallucination**: Grounded in real examples  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is powerful when:\n",
    "- You have high-quality example documents\n",
    "- Output quality matters (not just correctness)\n",
    "- Domain-specific knowledge is needed\n",
    "- You want to incorporate institutional knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand RAG, we'll:\n",
    "1. Integrate it into the DocumentGenerator agent\n",
    "2. Build a knowledge base management system\n",
    "3. Add evaluation to measure RAG impact\n",
    "4. Deploy to production\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these to deepen your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add more examples**: Create 2-3 more knowledge base entries in different categories\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test edge cases**: What happens when you query about a category not in the KB?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiment with k**: Try n_results=1, 2, 3, 4. How does it affect output?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Metadata filtering**: Modify search to only retrieve from one category\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quality comparison**: Generate 3 documents (with/without RAG) and compare side-by-side\n",
    "\n",
