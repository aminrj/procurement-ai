    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measurement is Essential**\n",
    "   - Can't improve what you don't measure\n",
    "   - Subjective assessment (\"looks good\") is not enough\n",
    "   - Metrics provide objective truth\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Good Test Sets are Hard**\n",
    "   - Need diverse, balanced, representative cases\n",
    "   - Edge cases are where systems fail\n",
    "   - Document your reasoning for each label\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Metrics Tell the Full Story**\n",
    "   - Precision vs Recall trade-off\n",
    "   - F1 balances both\n",
    "   - Calibration ensures confidence is trustworthy\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Enables Science**\n",
    "   - A/B test prompts objectively\n",
    "   - Track changes over time\n",
    "   - Prevent regressions\n",

    "   - Fix the weakest area first\n",
    "   - Re-evaluate after each change\n",

    "4. **Establish regression testing**\n",
