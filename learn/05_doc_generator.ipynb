    "\n",
    "1. **Temperature matters** - Higher (0.7) for creativity, lower (0.1) for consistency\n",
    "2. **Detailed prompts maintain quality** - Specificity prevents generic output\n",
    "3. **Structured output works for long-form** - Even creative content can be structured\n",
    "4. **Context is critical** - Pass in strengths, categories, tender details\n",
    "5. **Constraints enable creativity** - Guidelines prevent poor quality\n",

    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| Temperature 0.7 | Variety in expression, not robotic |\n",

    "| Detailed writing guidelines | Professional tone without prompt injection |\n",

    "| Task | Temperature | Why |\n",
    "|------|-------------|-----|\n",
    "| Classification | 0.0 - 0.2 | Maximum consistency |\n",

    "| Analysis | 0.3 - 0.5 | Some variation acceptable |\n",
    "| Generation | 0.6 - 0.8 | Creative but controlled |\n",
